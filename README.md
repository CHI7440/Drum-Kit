"I designed a clean and minimalist interface for a Drum Kit web application, featuring large drum buttons for intuitive interaction. The implementation utilized JavaScript to manage event listeners and button animations, while a separate CSS file handled the styling of all visual elements. The Drum Kit incorporated seven distinct drum sounds, including Kick, Snare, Crash, and Toms 1-4. Users had the flexibility to trigger sounds either by clicking on the individual drum buttons or by pressing corresponding keyboard keys (w, a, s, d, j, k, l). The technologies employed for this project encompassed JavaScript for functionality, HTML for structure, and CSS for visually appealing design."
